# James Geib - Full-Stack Web Development/Adobe Creative Cloud Online Portfolio

An online portfolio designed to showcase my abilities/work in full-stack web development and Adobe Create Cloud applications. In other words, a visual representation of my résumé.

## Motivation

Given my credentials, I believed the best way to attest for my technical knowledge would be to create an application made with those very skills. After all, a simple résumé can "tell" an employer or potential client of my aptitude, but an online portfolio can "show" them.
