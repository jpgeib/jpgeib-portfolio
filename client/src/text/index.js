    paragraph1: "I am a graduate of UC Berkeley Extension's Coding Boot Camp with a certificate in Full-Stack Web Development, and Fordham University with two Bachelor's degrees in Communications: Digital Technology and Emerging Media, and Film/Television Studies. Currently living in Milford, CT; willing to relocate if necessary.",
    paragraph2: "I am proficient in HTML5, CSS/CSS Frameworks, Javascript/jQuery, and SQL coding languages, and have experience working in MERN stack development. I specialize mostly in front-end development and design, enhanced by knowledge in Adobe Creative Cloud applications, but I can also work in back-end development when needed.",
    paragraph3: "I am ideally looking for a position that will allow me to utilize my ability to create an eye-catching, yet simple user-friendly interface for websites, apps, and other digital media, in order to enhance the user experience with a visually optimized client-side service. Having been on the consumer side of various software, I understand the frustration users may have when navigating through different pages/menus just to find one small piece of information. My mission as a front-end developer is to create an intuitive, easy-to-follow format that minimizes any confusion or difficulty in using."
